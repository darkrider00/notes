cloud - network of data centers

instead of describing a complex web of software , servers, computers, networks, and security systems  we use one word called cloud 

on premises
- on prem
- hardware and software hosted within org
- traditional way for managing IT infra
- req physical space , expert personnel , often require more computing resources 

private cloud
- infra is dedicated to single organization 
- single-tenant or corporate cloud 
- hosted within org or at org own data center ,
- or third party facilitator
- for private data

public cloud 
- on demand third party service provider where on demand computing services and infra managed by  third party provider
- shared to tenants
- multi cloud infra 
- a apartment has many tenants and each tenant is living private 
- no need to acquire, manage 
types:
 1. IAAS - compute and storage services
 2. PAAS - development and deployment 
 3. SAAS - services to get access to software on subscription basis

hybrid cloud
- mostly this and multi are same
- applications run in diff env  
Multi cloud
- mostly companies follow this
- combing both physical and diff organization 


Due to those 
we have - scalable 
flexible 
AGILE -develop and deploy fast 
strategic value 
secure -due to depth of mech 
cost effective - only pay for what they use 

- save costs, faster sec, reduction of management load , focusing on new capabilities (digitalization is made easy)

### Challenges

- best at understanding and using data 
- best tech infra 
- creating a hybrid workplace 
- know their data, systems is secure 
- prioritize sustainability 

Five capabilities
- Data - for AI and analyzing (data driven org)
- open infra - choose to modernize , bring services to physical locations
	 1. open standard - particular specifications and guidelines eg: http protocol to send specific info 
	 2. open source - publicly accessible 
- collaborations-  workspaces , communication and collaboration Eg: google apps
- Trust - helps org protect what's imp using security protocols and mechanisms
- Sustainable Technology

Google cloud framework base 
- short term tactical
- mid term strategic 
- long term transformational obj 

cloud maturity assessment helps to establish where an organization is currently regarding the cloud adoption recognized by google cloud

after cloud maturity has been assessed and actions have been recommended it's easy to scope and structure a cloud adaption program using the framework


Review of section :

- digital infra is important for technology evolution and cost effectiveness
- 2 or more types are used by single organization
