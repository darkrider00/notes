A successful SQL injection attack can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as:

- Passwords.
- Credit card details.
- Personal user information.

## detecting SQL injection
- The single quote character `'` and look for errors or other anomalies.
- Some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and look for systematic differences in the application responses.
- Boolean conditions such as `OR 1=1` and `OR 1=2`, and look for differences in the application's responses.
- Payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed within a SQL query, and look for differences in the time taken to respond.
- [OAST](https://portswigger.net/burp/application-security-testing/oast) payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within a SQL query, and monitor any resulting interactions.

SQL in dff parts of query 
- In `UPDATE` statements, within the updated values or the `WHERE` clause.
- In `INSERT` statements, within the inserted values.
- In `SELECT` statements, within the table or column name.
- In `SELECT` statements, within the `ORDER BY` clause.

## SQL injection examples

There are lots of SQL injection vulnerabilities, attacks, and techniques, that occur in different situations. Some common SQL injection examples include:

- [Retrieving hidden data](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection#retrieving-hidden-data), where you can modify a SQL query to return additional results.
- [Subverting application logic](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection#subverting-application-logic), where you can change a query to interfere with the application's logic.
- [UNION attacks](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks), where you can retrieve data from different database tables.
- [Blind SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/blind), where the results of a query you control are not returned in the application's responses.

## retreiving hidden data 
Imagine a shopping application that displays products in different categories. When the user clicks on the **Gifts** category, their browser requests the URL:

`https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts`

This causes the application to make a SQL query to retrieve details of the relevant products from the database:

`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1`

Imagine an application that lets users log in with a username and password. If a user submits the username `wiener` and the password `bluecheese`, the application checks the credentials by performing the following SQL query:

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'`

If the query returns the details of a user, then the login is successful. Otherwise, it is rejected.

In this case, an attacker can log in as any user without the need for a password. They can do this using the SQL comment sequence `--` to remove the password check from the `WHERE` clause of the query. For example, submitting the username `administrator'--` and a blank password results in the following query:

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''`

This query returns the user whose `username` is `administrator` and successfully logs the attacker in as that user.

You can use the `UNION` keyword to execute an additional `SELECT` query and append the results to the original query.

For example, if an application executes the following query containing the user input `Gifts`:

`SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'`

An attacker can submit the input:

`' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`

This causes the application to return all usernames and passwords along with the names and descriptions of products.
