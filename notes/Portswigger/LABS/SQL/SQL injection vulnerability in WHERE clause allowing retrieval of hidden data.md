if you don't know about what is SQL injection refer to [[SQL injection]]

in this description it's saying that there is a SQL vuln in product category filter ,
to solve this lab we need to perform a SQL injection that causes application to display unreleases products

this is the website dashboard 
since it's mentioned that there is a vulnerability in product category let's select the product category and capture the request in burp suite

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
- here we are selecting products where category = gifts And Released =1 so we gave to exploit the category here

we've selected category and got a request we can modify this request to view the unreleased products

so let's send this to repeater and inject a payload and see what happens

i added '  at the end of the url to check for sql injection and i got internal server error

- so we can add category = ' 'Or 1=1-- and encode it in the request and we solved the lab
