structure
- user defined data types that allow programmer to group related data items of different data types into a single unit 
- can be used store dta related to particular obj
- helps organize large amounts of data
- Each item within a struct is called a "member" or "element", these terms are used interchangeably within the course.
- Below is an example of the `THREADENTRY32` struct
```
typedef struct tagTHREADENTRY32 {
  DWORD dwSize; // Member 1
  DWORD cntUsage; // Member 2
  DWORD th32ThreadID;
  DWORD th32OwnerProcessID;
  LONG  tpBasePri;
  LONG  tpDeltaPri;
  DWORD dwFlags;
 } THREADENTRY32;
```

### Declaring
```
typedef struct _STRUCTURE_NAME {

  // structure elements

} STRUCTURE_NAME, *PSTRUCTURE_NAME;
```

### Initializing a Structure
```
STRUCTURE_NAME    struct1 = { 0 };  // The '{ 0 }' part, is used to initialize all the elements of struct1 to zero
// OR
_STRUCTURE_NAME   struct2 = { 0 };  // The '{ 0 }' part, is used to initialize all the elements of struct2 to zero
This is different when initializing the structure pointer, PSTRUCTURE_NAME.

PSTRUCTURE_NAME structpointer = NULL;
```

### **Accessing Structures Members**

```
typedef struct _STRUCTURE_NAME {
  int ID;
  int Age;
} STRUCTURE_NAME, *PSTRUCTURE_NAME;

STRUCTURE_NAME struct1 = { 0 }; // initialize all elements of struct1 to zero
struct1.ID   = 1470;   // initialize the ID element
struct1.Age  = 34;     // initialize the Age element
```

OR
```
typedef struct _STRUCTURE_NAME {
  int ID;
  int Age;
} STRUCTURE_NAME, *PSTRUCTURE_NAME;

STRUCTURE_NAME struct1 = { .ID   = 1470,  .Age  = 34}; // initialize both the ID and the Age elements


On the other hand, accessing and initializing a structure through its pointer is done via the arrow operator (`->`).
typedef struct _STRUCTURE_NAME {
  int ID;
  int Age;
} STRUCTURE_NAME, *PSTRUCTURE_NAME;

STRUCTURE_NAME struct1 = { .ID   = 1470,  .Age  = 34};

PSTRUCTURE_NAME structpointer = &struct1; // structpointer is a pointer to the 'struct1' structure

// Updating the ID member
structpointer->ID = 8765;
printf("The structure's ID member is now : %d \n", structpointer->ID);


```

The arrow operator can be converted into dot format. For example, `structpointer->ID` is equivalent to `(*structpointer).ID`


## Passy by value and reference

Pass by value 
```
```
int add(int a, int b)
{
   int result = a + b;
   return result;
}

int main()
{
   int x = 5;
   int y = 10;
   int sum = add(x, y); // x and y are passed by value

   return 0;
}
```
```

Pass by reference


```
void add(int *a, int *b, int *result)
{

  int A = *a; // A is now the same value of a passed in from the main function
  int B = *b; // B is now the same value of b passed in from the main function

  *result = B + A;
}

int main()
{
   int x = 5;
   int y = 10;
   int sum = 0;

   add(&x, &y, &sum);

   // 'sum' now is 15

   return 0;
}
```
