- Everything in a file is linux 
- contains several files , which includes datafiles, directories , systemfiles, library files etc
- file are stored in hierarchical format (directories and sub directories)
- inode or index node is a linux DS that describe objects of file sytems , their names owner account and permissions (metadata)
- directory structure and inode provide a framework to store file and directory metadata
-  It’s a unique number for files and directories under a disk block/partition.

## **What are the important** **attrib****utes** **included in inode?**

The below mentioned keys are the different attributes in Unix file system and are included in inode.

- File type.
- File permission.
- Ownership and group.
- Size.
- Access, change and modification time.
- Deletion time.
- Number of links.

## **How do I check the inode details of a file or directory?**

Do you have a shell access to your server? If so, yes, you can simply check the inode number by using the following commands:

1. **ls -i**
2. **stat**

**See the sample outputs**

### **1. By using ls command.**

The switch “i” uses with ls command to find out the inode number of a file or directory. See the sample output pasted below:

**arunlal@localhost:~$ touch inode.check

arunlal@localhost:~$ ls -i inode.check
1179765 inode.check**

Here the inode for the file “inode.check” is **1179765**.

### **2. By using stat command.**

The “stat” command will display the inode number along with a lot of other attributes. See the output:

**arunlal@localhost:~$ stat inode.check
  File: 'inode.check'
  Size: 0         	Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   regular empty file
Device: 806h/2054d	Inode: 1179765     Links: 1
Access: (0664/-rw-rw-r--)  Uid: ( 1000/ arunlal)   Gid: ( 1000/ arunlal)
Access: 2016-11-15 20:00:07.548968280 +0530
Modify: 2016-11-15 20:00:07.548968280 +0530
Change: 2016-11-15 20:00:07.548968280 +0530
 Birth: -**

In this output you can see a lot of attributes of the file “inode.check.”

You can also use these commands to check the details of directories. See one example pasted below:

**arunlal@localhost:~$ mkdir inode.check.dir

arunlal@localhost:~$ stat inode.check.dir
  File: 'inode.check.dir'
  Size: 4096      	Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   directory
Device: 806h/2054d	Inode: 1314947     Links: 2
Access: (0775/drwxrwxr-x)  Uid: ( 1000/ arunlal)   Gid: ( 1000/ arunlal)
Access: 2016-11-15 20:09:21.734325138 +0530
Modify: 2016-11-15 20:09:21.734325138 +0530
Change: 2016-11-15 20:09:21.734325138 +0530
 Birth: -**

Total inode usage on the Linux machine can be calculated from the ”df” command along with the usage of switch “i.” Please see the details pasted below:

**$ df -i
Filesystem      Inodes  IUsed   IFree IUse% Mounted on
udev            489347    557  488790    1% /dev
tmpfs           494198    802  493396    1% /run
/dev/sda6      3932160 238966 3693194    7% /
tmpfs           494198    150  494048    1% /dev/shm**

That’s it! Try it and add comments if you have any other ideas on it.

## Inode and Hard/Soft Links

When you create hard or soft links, a new file is created. However, the inode works differently for both hard and soft links. 

When you create a soft link for a file or directory, the link file has a different inode number than the original file. Whereas, in the case of a hard link, the original file and the link file both have the same inode number. This is because the hard link provides a new name to the same data and thus can be accessed using the same inode number.


## What Are Hard Links and Soft Links?

In Linux, you can create two types of links to files:

|Type|Also Known As|Analogy|
|---|---|---|
|**Hard Link**|Actual Clone|Multiple names for **same file**|
|**Soft Link**|Symbolic Link / Symlink|Shortcut or alias to the file|
## 🔗 Hard Link

### ✅ Behavior:

- **Points directly to the same inode** as the original file.
    
- **Shares** the same content (not a copy).
    
- Even if the original file is deleted, the data remains accessible via the hard link.

### 📌 Inode Info:

- **Same inode number** for both original and hard link.
### 📁 Example:

`touch file.txt ln file.txt hardlink.txt ls -i`

`123456 file.txt 
`123456 hardlink.txt

Same inode → they are really the same file with **different names**.

## Soft Link (Symbolic Link)

### ✅ Behavior:

- Like a **shortcut**.
    
- Points to the **filename**, not directly to the inode.
    
- If the original file is deleted, the soft link breaks (becomes a "dangling link").
    
### 📌 Inode Info:

- **Different inode number** than the original file.
    
### 📁 Example:

`touch file.txt ln -s file.txt softlink.txt ls -li`

`123456 file.txt 789101 softlink.txt -> file.txt`

Different inodes → softlink is a separate file that **points to the original by name**.
