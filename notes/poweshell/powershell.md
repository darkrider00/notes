Why?
- takes advantage of living off the land concept where using tools that are built into OS work to our advantage once we've obtained access to system
- better control over the shell or system that u've been compromised
- Many organizations aren't actively hunting for PowerShell activity since it is usually considered a "trusted" application.
- We can use PowerShell to run, download or execute code, entirely within the memory process of the PowerShell executable, helping us evade endpoint security solutions.
- We can use it to interface with the .NET and other Windows APIs.
ex : API hooking and all
- We can call Windows DLL functions from within PowerShell.
- We can use it to bypass application whitelisting implementations by running the usual operating system commands from the PowerShell CLI.
- Many tools are already available to us for a large number of purposes related to penetration testing.
- Having access to all of those things through PowerShell helps us reduce our footprint and evade defense mechanisms while conducting post-exploitation tasks. 
- PowerShell is also easy to use, and there are many scripts and frameworks written that we can utilize for our offensive purposes.
- Furthermore, it doesn't take much to create our own scripts to carry out some of our tasks as we'll see in the modules that follow.

The PowerShell CLI provides us with access to built-in cmdlets, modules, functions, features, and provides way to create tasks, functions, variables interactively, and more, directly from the CLI.

### Version:

- We can use the -Version parameter followed by a version number as the argument to downgrade the version of PowerShell. 
- Useful in scenarios where you've landed on a machine with a more recent version and need to downgrade to Version 1.0 or 2.0 or to complete certain tasks.
- Requires that older versions are still installed on the target.
		`C: \ > power shell .exe -Version 2`
