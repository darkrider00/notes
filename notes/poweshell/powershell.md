Why?
- takes advantage of living off the land concept where using tools that are built into OS work to our advantage once we've obtained access to system
- better control over the shell or system that u've been compromised
- Many organizations aren't actively hunting for PowerShell activity since it is usually considered a "trusted" application.
- We can use PowerShell to run, download or execute code, entirely within the memory process of the PowerShell executable, helping us evade endpoint security solutions.
- We can use it to interface with the .NET and other Windows APIs.
ex : API hooking and all
- We can call Windows DLL functions from within PowerShell.
- We can use it to bypass application whitelisting implementations by running the usual operating system commands from the PowerShell CLI.
- Many tools are already available to us for a large number of purposes related to penetration testing.
- Having access to all of those things through PowerShell helps us reduce our footprint and evade defense mechanisms while conducting post-exploitation tasks. 
- PowerShell is also easy to use, and there are many scripts and frameworks written that we can utilize for our offensive purposes.
- Furthermore, it doesn't take much to create our own scripts to carry out some of our tasks as we'll see in the modules that follow.

The PowerShell CLI provides us with access to built-in cmdlets, modules, functions, features, and provides way to create tasks, functions, variables interactively, and more, directly from the CLI.

### Version:

- We can use the -Version parameter followed by a version number as the argument to downgrade the version of PowerShell. 
- Useful in scenarios where you've landed on a machine with a more recent version and need to downgrade to Version 1.0 or 2.0 or to complete certain tasks.
- Requires that older versions are still installed on the target.
		`C: \ > power shell .exe -Version 2`

### running the basic commands

- to check if we r running 64 bit or 32 bit powershell the command is 
		`[environment]::Is64BitProcess`

![[Pasted image 20240909205937.png]]

above is powershell with admin privileges

![[Pasted image 20240909210003.png]]


we can use tab to autocomplete for commands in powershell

above is PowerShell (X86)

- setting execution policy to unrestircted 

![[Pasted image 20240909210554.png]]


![[Pasted image 20240909210640.png]]


- script to open calclulator 

![[Pasted image 20240909211627.png]]

as soon as i executed the command without opening PowerShell windows calculator opened 

instead or -ExecutionPolicy we can use -ep

- command to get all windows security logs
![[Pasted image 20240909212231.png]]

command : `powershell.exe -ep Unrestricted -Command "& { GET-EventLog -LogName security`


### cmdlets

- cmdlets are light weight PowerShell scripts that perform a single function 
- most cmdlets by default will return a limited set of information or columns
- command : `Get-Children | Format-list *`
- names whether in list format or default column format are important , as we can use those to filter the output  of cmdlet objects for specific properties
- usually cmdlets outputs are referred to objects
- objects can be further processed using what is known as pipelining (similar to how we can chain commands together)
- example : `Get-Process | Sort-Object -Unique| select-Object ProcessName`

![[Pasted image 20240910180348.png]]

- as we can see if we jsut type Get-Process command we get more colums 
- we can sort it by the process name using the above command
![[Pasted image 20240910180604.png]]

as we can see we get only process id names , apart from process name we can specify other parameters that we want to display then the command would be 

`Get-Process | Sort-Object -Unique |Select-Object ProcessName , Handles`

![[Pasted image 20240910181000.png]]

- we can redirect the results of our pipeline to a file using a standard operator the command would be 
`Get-Process | Sort-Object -Unique |Select-Object ProcessName > unique_process.txt`
let's execute it
