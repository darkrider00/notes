Why?
- takes advantage of living off the land concept where using tools that are built into OS work to our advantage once we've obtained access to system
- better control over the shell or system that u've been compromised
- Many organizations aren't actively hunting for PowerShell activity since it is usually considered a "trusted" application.
- We can use PowerShell to run, download or execute code, entirely within the memory process of the PowerShell executable, helping us evade endpoint security solutions.
- We can use it to interface with the .NET and other Windows APIs.
