[Bookmarklets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet)Â are browser bookmarks that execute JavaScript instead of opening a webpage. They're also known as bookmark applets, favlets, or JavaScript bookmarks.


## Use Cases for Bookmarklets

With bookmarklets, you can manipulate the current page as the function will have the context of the current tab. This means you can:

- Click buttons virtually
    
- Modify the content
    
- Use the content of the page to open a new page
    
- Remove elements from the page
