### stay lean over a very long time or forever
general science based cutting rule is 0.5 - 1 % per week 

my weight : 150lbs = 250-300g per week 
this is if we want to loose 20lbs 

20 % below of current maintenance  until desired weight loss
2250 -450 (20%) = 1800

after that get back to maintenance calories 2250 
you can eat (2250 - 2600 calories) 

track ur calories daily and check weight and do internment fasting

### metabolism 
- how many calories burn per day 
more metabolism means can eat more calories per day 
- extremely individual 
-each glass of cold water speed up mechanism 
-green tea  mostly have no effect only one study shows 79 calories but ends after 24 hrs
-spicy food - increase metabolism (chilli, pepper)
Sauna - don't work 
cold exposure - increase metabolism 10 min of complete cold exposure burns  28-30 calories, sitting in room at room temp burns 10-14 so not much 

Reverse dieting -refer to above 
cardio - burns calories
