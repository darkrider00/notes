### stay lean over a very long time or forever
general science based cutting rule is 0.5 - 1 % per week 

my weight : 150lbs = 250-300g per week 
this is if we want to loose 20lbs 

20 % below of current maintenance  until desired weight loss
2250 -450 (20%) = 1800

after that get back to maintenance calories 2250 
you can eat (2250 - 2600 calories) 

track ur calories daily and check weight and do internment fasting

### metabolism 
- how many calories burn per day 
more metabolism means can eat more calories per day 
- extremely individual 
-each glass of cold water speed up mechanism 
-green tea  mostly have no effect only one study shows 79 calories but ends after 24 hrs
-spicy food - increase metabolism (chilli, pepper)
Sauna - don't work 
cold exposure - increase metabolism 10 min of complete cold exposure burns  28-30 calories, sitting in room at room temp burns 10-14 so not much 

Reverse dieting -refer to above 
cardio - burns calories 
-causes energy compensation which results in burning more calories in cario less calories in neat
-having weights daily 

avoid dieting low calorie foods
-increase activities (taking stairs parking further away , increasing NEAT activities)


### fundamentals

if u can do 2 more reps in the last set u can increase weight from next week 
training to failure - compound exercises
sets - isolation exercises

total work = sets * reps * load
major factor  = sets (tough sets (training to failure or until 3-4 reps left))
min amount of vol to get gains is at low volume u can get gains at some point u need more volume to get more gains at some point u overtrain results to loss of gain 

bigger muscle groups  - chest back quads ....
small groups - triceps , biceps, .... (get worked when u do big muscle groups)

Are you getting stronger ? yes okay no - add more work or weights
