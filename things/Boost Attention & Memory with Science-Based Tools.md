novelty - quality of being new 
- whenever we see a new object our brain remembers more

#### **1. Properties That Make Things Memorable**

- **Novelty**
    - The brain is wired to notice and remember new or unusual experiences.
    - Examples: Unique visuals, unexpected scenarios, or surprising facts.
    - Application: When studying, seek creative ways to present information, like using analogies or storytelling.
    
- **Repetition**
    - Consistent exposure to information strengthens neural pathways.
    - Spaced repetition techniques (reviewing at intervals) are scientifically proven to enhance long-term memory.
    - Application: Use tools like flashcards or spaced repetition apps (e.g., Anki).
    
- **Association**
    - Connecting new information to familiar concepts helps it "stick."
    - Examples: Mnemonics, mind maps, or linking ideas to personal experiences.
    - Application: Create meaningful connections, such as "Hippocampus sounds like 'campus,' where learning occurs."
    
- **Emotional Resonance**
    - Emotionally charged experiences are remembered more vividly due to the amygdala's influence on memory.
    - Examples: Learning through impactful stories or attaching personal significance to the material.
    - Application: Visualize yourself succeeding with the knowledge you’re acquiring.

#### **2. Role of the Hippocampus in Memory**

- The **hippocampus** is a critical part of the brain, located in the temporal lobe, responsible for:
    - Forming and organizing new memories.
    - Associating memories with emotions.
    - Transferring short-term memories into long-term storage.
- Importance of Hippocampus Health:
    - Regular exercise, learning new skills, and stress reduction can support hippocampal function.
    - Damage or shrinkage of the hippocampus (e.g., from stress or aging) leads to memory issues.

#### **3. Benefits of Exercise for Brain Development**

- **Prefrontal Cortex and Hippocampus**
    - Exercise stimulates neurogenesis (growth of new brain cells) in the hippocampus.
    - It strengthens the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for decision-making, self-control, and focus.
    
- **Mechanisms of Exercise on the Brain**
    - Releases **BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)**, which supports brain cell survival and connectivity.
    - Enhances blood flow and oxygenation, improving overall brain function.
    
- **Morning Exercise Benefits**
    - Sets a productive tone for the day.
    - Boosts mood and energy levels.
    - Increases dopamine and endorphins, improving motivation and reducing anxiety.

#### **4. Strategies to Improve Attention Span**

- **Exercise**
    - Activities like aerobic workouts, yoga, or even brisk walking improve focus.
    - Exercise regulates stress hormones (e.g., cortisol), improving mental clarity.
    
- **Meditation**
    - Practices like mindfulness meditation train the brain to stay in the present moment.
    - Benefits: Reduces distractions, improves emotional regulation, and increases gray matter in the brain.
    - Tools: Guided apps like Calm or Headspace, or simple breathing techniques.
    
- **Sleep**
    - Essential for memory consolidation and attention regulation.
    - Poor sleep leads to reduced hippocampal activity, impairing memory formation.
    - Tips: Maintain a regular sleep schedule, avoid screens before bed, and create a restful environment.
