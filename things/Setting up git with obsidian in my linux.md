ive configured the github by refering this 
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/set-up-git

for generating and adding new SSH key refer this 
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"


## [Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent)

Before adding a new SSH key to the ssh-agent to manage your keys, you should have checked for existing SSH keys and generated a new SSH key.

1. Start the ssh-agent in the background.
    
    shell
    $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    > Agent pid 59566
    

Depending on your environment, you may need to use a different command. For example, you may need to use root access by running sudo -s -H before starting the ssh-agent, or you may need to use exec ssh-agent bash or exec ssh-agent zsh to run the ssh-agent.

1. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent.
    
    If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_ed25519 in the command with the name of your private key file.
    
    shell
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    

If you see an error like "Could not open a connection to your authentication agent", then run:

bash

CopyEdit

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

### *Copy the Public Key*

To copy your SSH public key:

bash

CopyEdit

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

or

bash

CopyEdit

xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub  # (For GUI clipboard)

### *Add the Key to GitHub/GitLab (if using for Git)*

- *GitHub:* Go to [GitHub SSH Keys](https://github.com/settings/keys) → New SSH Key → Paste your key.
- *GitLab:* Go to [GitLab SSH Keys](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/keys) → New SSH Key → Paste your key.

---

### *Test the Connection*

Try:

bash

CopyEdit

ssh -T git@github.com

If added correctly, you'll see:

vbnet

Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

After doing this i tried git push  i got  this 

![[Pasted image 20250307204932.png]]

installed necessary things and logged in 

shell
perplex00@pop-os:~/Documents/notes$ git push
Everything up-to-date

 but even then i got this 

![[Pasted image 20250307204921.png]]

so ive deleted the directories and git cloned and got this error:

```shell
perplex00@pop-os:~/Documents$ git clone https://github.com/darkrider00/notes.git Cloning into 'notes'... remote: Enumerating objects: 3188, done. remote: Counting objects: 100% (56/56), done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (43/43), done. error: RPC failed; curl 92 HTTP/2 stream 0 was not closed cleanly: CANCEL (err 8) error: 7409 bytes of body are still expected fetch-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet fatal: early EOF fatal: fetch-pack: invalid index-pack output perplex00@pop-os:~/Documents$
```

This error is usually related to network issues, large repository sizes, or Git buffer settings. 

Run the following command to increase the buffer size:

`git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000`

Since you've set up SSH, try cloning using SSH instead of HTTPS:

`git clone git@github.com:darkrider00/notes.git`

and it worked
