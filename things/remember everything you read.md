     - P - procedural - how something should be executed
         - key to remember is practice
         - immediately practice dont read and practice 2 weeks later
         - what if we read and dont have practice?
             - move on stop reading

- the consumption period and digestion period must be balanced in order to retain and use it

A- analogous
- easiest time of info
- info related to something you already have prior knowledge about 
     we are a swimmer we r learning  about muscle contraction then we gonna go if feels like the swimming i do expands and contracting
     - can form with any prior knowlegde

in above example ...
in what ays swimming and contraction similar,
in what ways swimming and contraction differ
- increases retention and memory standards
- extending from what we know 

A - analogy is subset of procedural also subset of conceptual

Conceptual - facts and explanations,
theories principles
both procedural and conceptual = solve problems
- use mapping 
- increasing retention

if we don't have time to map we need to slow down or stop 


Evidence - evidence 
info that makes conceptual info more concrete 
- store and rehearse
- as soon as we find some related info we can go ahead and put that in it
