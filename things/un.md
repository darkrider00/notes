MOVEMENT BY DAVID 12 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSWHAT DOES STATIC, DYNAMIC, ACTIVE AND PASSIVE STRETCHING MEAN?The terms "static" and "dynamic" describe the presence or absence of movementduring stretching. "Dynamic" stretching involves actively moving through a range ofmotion, while "static" stretching entails holding a position without movement. On theother hand, "passive" and "active" stretching pertain to the level of muscleengagement. In "passive" stretching, the muscle being stretched is relaxed as muchas possible, whereas in "active" stretching, you engage the muscle to its safe limit

CAN I MODIFY THE PROGRAM IF I HAVE PRE-EXISTING SHOULDER ISSUES?Absolutely! If you have pre-existing shoulder issues or limitations, it's important toconsult with a healthcare professional or a qualified instructor. They can provide youwith modifications and exercises tailored to your specific needs and ensure a safe andeffective practice

CAN I COMBINE THE SHOULDER MOBILITY EXERCISES WITH OTHER FORMS OF EXERYes, you can combine the shoulder mobility exercises with other forms of exercise.However, it's essential to prioritize proper form and avoid overexertion.

13 MOVEMENT BY DAVID FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSWHAT DO I DO IF I MISS A DAY IN THE ROUTINE?Missing a day is completely fine! The program does not require specific days to beassigned for stretching. As long as you complete the recommended three days ofstretching within a week, you have flexibility in choosing which days to perform theroutine. Consistency is key, so if you miss a day, simply continue with the program onthe following day

HOW LONG SHOULD I CONTINUE THE PROGRAM AFTER THE INITIAL FOUR WEEKS?It is recommended to continue the program beyond the initial four weeks.

13 MOVEMENT BY DAVID FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSWHAT DO I DO IF I MISS A DAY IN THE ROUTINE?Missing a day is completely fine! The program does not require specific days to beassigned for stretching. As long as you complete the recommended three days ofstretching within a week, you have flexibility in choosing which days to perform theroutine. Consistency is key, so if you miss a day, simply continue with the program onthe following day

HOW LONG SHOULD I CONTINUE THE PROGRAM AFTER THE INITIAL FOUR WEEKS?It is recommended to continue the program beyond the initial four weeks.
