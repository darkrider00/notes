- neuromodulators - things like dopamine and chemicals

thoughts
- perceptions 
- draw from things happened in the present and things we want and anticipation in the future
- can be reflexive they can pop up or deliberate (we can have a thought)

most of nervous system is devoted to converting sensation , perception, feelings , thoughts into actions

reflexive - central pattern generators , if u want to walk you know how to walk
 group of neurons generate actions
can be deliberate - if there or rocks u need 2 left foots or jump or something 

if somebody says something  that's triggering and you are saying you shouldn't respond you shouldn't respond , you are actively suppressing your behavior through top down processing this is stress

in young children if they sees a chocolate they want they will go and grab and in adults they ill ask or wait until they r offered 

impulsivity is a lack of control of top down approach 
- when we don't want to do something we indulge in this process and it feels like agitation because it's accompanied by the release of a neuromodulator called norepinephrine called adrenaline  

for neuroplasticity agitation or top  down processing  
- we can direct our own neural changes 
- we can decide how we want to change how the brain works

plasticity in adult nervous system is  gated meaning it is controlled by neuromodulators 
- dopamine and serotonin and acetylcholine open up neuro plasticity 
- when something very bad happens there is the release of two sets of neuromodulators in the brain
   1. Epinephrine - makes us feel alert and agitated associated with bad circumstances
   2. acetylcholine -  even more intense and focus spotlight to one region of experience
