### Required Components

You will need to install some/all of these before downloading any games (legitimate or pirated!) to stop games crashing due to missing software on your computer:

- [DirectX](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35)
- [VisualCppRedist AIO](https://github.com/abbodi1406/vcredist/releases/latest)
- [XNA Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914)
- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet)

To extract games, use either of these two:

- [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) - for opening 7z/Rar archives.
- [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) - for opening Rar archives. Has better compatibility with RAR archives. Use this if you have compatibility issues with RAR files, specially for multipart files.

### Torrent Sites

==You will need to install a torrent client and likely need a VPN to download torrents to avoid receiving Copyright notices from your ISP== - unless, your country does not care about piracy. Read more in the VPN section further in this thread. Torrents are P2P downloads - you download from other people who have downloaded the file. No servers are involved.

For a list of uploaders to stay away from, please check the [Untrusted Uploaders](https://rentry.org/pgames/###untrusted-uploaders) section.

- [1337x](https://1337x.to/) - Add `||1337x.vpnonly.site` to uBlock Origin -> My Filters tab in uBlock settings. | **Please get the games from only the following uploaders for games: (Any names from [cs.rin.ru](http://cs.rin.ru/), 0xEMPRESS, anadius, DODI, FitGirl, JohnCena141 (Linux), KaOsKrew, s7on3r, TinyRepacks).**
- [EMPRESS Releases](https://telegra.ph/empress-biography-07-15) - For games cracked by EMPRESS

### Direct Download (DDL) Sites

These sites provide games in pre-installed(non-repacked) form. Direct Downloads are like any regular download. You download the file from a server through a web browser. It is significantly safer to download this way and ==you will not need a VPN.== In some cases, you might need a DNS change to access blocked filehost sites. It is recommended to use a Download Manager mentioned below to help manage and slightly speed up your downloads.

Note: even if it may seem that a game which may not be so popular is there only in an unsafe site, please check [cs.rin.ru](http://cs.rin.ru/). These files will be usually clean(uncracked) files. Crack files will be given in the comments of the thread. If not, crack it yourself with the help of the tools listed in the [Tools Section.](https://rentry.org/pgames/#Tools)

While most of the stuff on [Archive.org](http://archive.org/), OldGamesDownload and MyAbandonware are safe, some can be unsafe too since the sources for the games there often have blurry lines! Please be careful when downloading anything from there.

### Repacks

Repacks are highly compressed games, designed for people with slow/limited internet speed/bandwidth. Once you download them, you must install them on your computer which can take a long time due to file decompression.

### Unsafe software

- **BitTorrent/μTorrent - Has baked in ads, trackers, and even BTC miners loaded with their software. The "safe version" of µTorrent, v2.2.1, isn't to be trusted as well due to confirmed security exploits.**
- **Any "cracked" VPN.**
- Avast - Notorious for collecting and selling user data.
- Bitlord - Malware risk.
- CCleaner - Owned by Avast.

### Untrusted sites

Note: even if it may seem that a game which may not be so popular is present only in an unsafe site, please check [cs.rin.ru](http://cs.rin.ru/). These files will be usually clean files. Crack files will be given in the comments of the thread. If not, crack it yourself with the help of the tools listed in the [Tools Section.](https://rentry.org/pgames/#Tools)

- **IGG Games / PCGamesTorrents / LoadGames / GamesTorrents - they doxxed mercs213 (owner of GoodOldDownloads), package their own DRM, crypto miners, as well as malware, and exploit you for ad revenue.**
- **SteamUnlocked / GOG Unlocked / ROMs Unlocked - slow downloads, malicious link redirects and uploads stolen from IGG Games and nosTEAM.**
- **TLauncher - contains spyware**
- **Any site which has been stopped/not owned by their original owners. These include:**
    - The Pirate Bay / TPB - Malware Risk. Skulled users and the uploader "dauphong" aren't safe either.

- **Any site you find on Google by searching for "free game downloads", "cracked games", etc. Google de-lists piracy websites from its search results, which means that fake and malware-spreading sites will float to the top of the search results. This also applies to searches on YouTube aswell.**
