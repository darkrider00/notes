**Market participants (humans and algorithms) move the stock price** based on **perceived value** — reacting to **news**, **rumors**, **economic data**, or **expectations**. The price is **not changed by a person or institution manually** — it's driven by **buy and sell orders** through the **stock exchange's order matching system**.

### 🤖 So How Does It Work “Automatically”?

Let’s take your **Infosys example**:

1. **At 10:00 AM**: Infosys is ₹3000.
    
2. **News comes**: "New CEO appointed."
    
3. **Market participants react**:
    
    - Investors believe this is good news.
        
    - More people want to **buy** Infosys.
        
    - Fewer people are willing to **sell at lower prices**.
        
    - Buyers are willing to **bid higher** just to get the stock.
        
4. **Order Book Reaction**:
    
    - Sellers now ask ₹3002 instead of ₹3000.
        
    - Buyers agree and place market orders.
        
    - Next seller says ₹3006, buyers still agree.
        
    - This **aggressive buying** causes the stock price to **climb quickly**.
        
5. **The Stock Exchange System**:
    
    - The stock exchange (like NSE or BSE) uses an **automated matching engine** to match buy and sell orders.
        
    - It does **not “decide” the price**, but rather reflects the **latest matched trade**.

### **Absolute Return**

 - **Used when:** Your investment period is **less than a year** or if you want to know total gain **regardless of time**.
 - The formula to calculate is – [Ending Period Value / Starting Period Value – 1] x 100
 I bought Infosys at 3030 and sold it at 3550. How much percentage return did I generate?
 The formula to calculate is – [Ending Period Value / Starting Period Value – 1]*100
i.e. [3550/3030 -1] *100

= 0.1716 * 100

= 17.16%

A 17.6% is not a bad return at all!

_**Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)** –_ An absolute return can be misleading if you want to compare two investments. CAGR helps you answer this question –
 I bought Infosys at 3030, held the stock for two years, and sold it at 3550. At what rate did my investment grow over the last two years?
 CAGR factors in the time component, which we had ignored when we computed the absolute return.
The formula to calculate CAGR is…
![CAGR](http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/CAGR.jpg)
Applying this to answer the question…
{[3550/3030]^(1/2) – 1} = 8.2%

 investment grew at a rate of 8.2% for two years. As of today, the bank fixed deposit market offers 5.5% with capital protection hence, 8.2% return looks ok compared to a fixed deposit.
- always use CAGR to check returns over multiple years. Use absolute return when your time frame is for a year or lesser.

What if you bought Infosys at 3030 and sold it at 3550 within six months? In that case, you have generated 17.16% in 6 months, which translates to 34.32% (17.16% * 2) for the year.

1. **Day Trader** – A day trader initiates and closes the position during the day. He does not carry forward trading positions overnight. A day trader is risk-averse and does not like taking an overnight risk. For example – Buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 at 9:15 AM and sell it at 2220 at 3:20 PM, making a profit of Rs.800/- in this trade. A day trader usually trades 5 to 6 stocks per day, sometimes even more.
2. **Scalper** – A type of day trader. A scalper usually trades very large shares and holds the stock for less time to make a small but quick profit. For example – a scalper buys 10,000 shares of TCS as 2212 at 9:15 and sells it 2212.1 at 9.16, ending up making 1000/- profit in this trade. On any given day, the scalper trades multiple times during the day. As you may have noticed, a scalp trader is highly risk-averse.
3. **Swing Trader** – A swing trader holds on to the trade for a slightly longer; the duration can run anywhere between a few days to weeks. For example – Buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 on 12th June and sell it at 2214 on 19th June.

An investor is a person who buys a stock expecting a significant appreciation in the stock. The investor is willing to wait for the investment to evolve. The typical holding period of investors usually runs into a few years. There are two popular types of investors.

1. 1. **Growth Investors** – The objective here is to identify companies expected to grow significantly because of emerging industry and macro trends. A classic example in the Indian context would be buying Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, and Gillette India back in 1990s. These companies witnessed huge growth because of the change in the industry landscape, creating massive wealth for their shareholders.
    2. **Value Investors** – The objective here is to identify good companies irrespective of whether they are in the growth or mature phase but beaten down significantly due to the short-term market sentiment, thereby making a great value buy. An example of this in recent times is stock tanking in the Covid crash of March 2020. Due to short-term negative sentiment, almost all the good stocks were beaten down significantly around March/April 2020, only to post a V-shaped recovery in the subsequent months.

 if I were to ask you how the stock market is moving today, how would you answer my question? There are approximately 5,000 listed companies on the Bombay Stock Exchange and about 2,000 on the National Stock Exchange. It would be clumsy to check every company, figure out if they are up or down for the day, and then give a detailed answer.

, identify a few companies to represent the broader markets. Whenever someone asks you how the markets are doing, you check the general trend of these selected stocks and then answer. These companies that you have identified collectively make up the stock market index!

There are a few important indices in India. The **S&P BSE Sensex** represents the Bombay stock exchange, and **the Nifty 50** represents the National Stock exchange. Apart from these two, there is the **Nifty Bank Index** (Bank Nifty), which is quite popular. Bank Nifty represents the banking sector as a whole.


the index also carries the S&P tag. NSE itself maintains the indices via a related company called NSE Indices Limited.

## Practical uses of the Index
- Index reflects the overall sentiment and trend in the market.  The index broadly represents the country’s state of the economy. A stock market index that is up indicates people are optimistic about the future. Likewise, people are pessimistic about the future when the stock market index is down.

For example, the Nifty 50 value as of 21st November 2022 is 18150, but around six months ago, the Nifty 50 was at 15820. The index has moved 2300 points or about 14.75% higher in six months, indicating bullishness in the market. In other words, market participants have been optimistic about the Indian economic future.

- The time frame for calculating the index can be for anything. For example, the Index at 9:30 AM on 21st November was 18140, but an hour later, it moved to 18099. A drop of nearly 40 within an hour. Such movement indicates that the market participants are not enthusiastic from a short-term perspective.

- **_Benchmarking_** _–_ A yardstick to measure the performance is required for all the trading or investing activity people do.  Assume over the last year, you invested Rs.100,000/- and generated Rs.20,000 return to make your total corpus Rs.120,000/-. How do you think you performed? Well, on the face of it, a 20% return looks great. However, what if Nifty moved to 30% during the same year?
- , it may seem to you that you have underperformed in the market! Usually, the objective of market participants is to outperform the Index. Now, if not for the Index, you can’t figure out how you performed in the stock market. It would be best if you had the index to benchmark the performance.

- **_Trading_** – Trading on the index is probably one of the most popular uses of the index. Majority of the traders in the market trade the index. They take a broader call on the economy or general state of affairs and translate that into a trade. The trader usually takes a short-term call on the index to trade.
-  At 10:30 AM, the Finance Minister is expected to deliver the budget speech. An hour before the announcement Nifty index is at 18,150 points. You expect the budget to be favorable to the nation’s economy. What do you think will happen to the index? Naturally, the index will move up. So to trade your point of view, you may want to buy the index at 18,150. After all, the index is the representation of the broader economy.

So as per your expectation, the budget is good, and the index moves to 18,450. You can now book your profits and exit the trade at a 300 points profit!  Trades such as these are possible through what is known as the ‘Derivative’ segment of the markets. We are probably a bit early to explore derivatives, but for now, do remember that index trading is possible through the derivative markets.


**_Portfolio Hedgin_**_**g** –_ Investors usually build a portfolio of stocks. A typical portfolio contains 15 – 20 held for the long term. While the stocks are held from a long-term perspective, they could foresee a prolonged adverse movement in the market (ex-2008), potentially eroding the capital in the portfolio. Investors can use the index to hedge the portfolio in such a situation. We will explore this topic in a futures trading module.

 ABC has 100 shares outstanding in the market, and the stock price is at 50, then the free-float market cap of ABC is 100*50 = Rs.5,000.

|Sl No|Name of the company|Industry|The weightage (%)|
|---|---|---|---|
|01|Reliance Industries Ltd|Oil & Gas|11.03|
|02|HDFC Bank Ltd|Bank|8.26|
|03|ICICI Bank Ltd|Bank|7.94|
|04|Infosys Ltd|IT|7.06|

|08|Kotak Mahindra Bank|Bank|3.51|
|09|L&T Ltd|Infra|3.07|
|10|Axis Bank Ltd|Bank|3.0|

 Reliance Industries Ltd has the highest weightage. This means the Nifty index is most sensitive to price changes in Reliance.

# [Commonly Used Jargons]

-  **Bull Market (Bullish)** _–_ If you expect the stock prices to go up, you are bullish on the stock price. From a broader perspective, if the stock market index is going up during a particular period, it is referred to as a bull market. Example – The market was bullish from mid-2020 to early 2022.
- **Bear Market (Bearish)** _–_ If you expect the stock prices to go down, you are bearish on the stock price. From a broader perspective, if the stock market index goes down during a particular period, it is referred to as a bear market. Example – The market was bearish from early 2008 to late 2009.
- **Trend** _–_ The term ‘trend’ usually refers to the general market direction and its associated momentum in the market. For example, if the market is declining fast, the trend is said to be bearish. If the market is trading flat with no movement, then the trend is said to be sideways.
- **Face value of a stock** – The face value (FV) or par value indicates the nominal value of a share. The face value is important from a corporate action perspective. We will discuss corporate action in a separate chapter. Usually, when dividends, stock splits, or bonuses are announced, they are issued, keeping the face value in perspective. For example, the FV of Infosys is 5, and if they announce an annual dividend of Rs.63/-, the dividend paid is 1260%s (63 divided by 5).
- **52-week high/low** – 52-week high is the highest price point at which a stock has traded during the last 52 weeks (which also marks a full calendar year); likewise, a 52-week low marks the lowest price point at which the stock has traded during the last 52 weeks. The 52-week high and low gives a sense of the range within which the stock trades during the year. Many traders believe that if a stock price reaches 52 weeks high, it indicates a bullish trend for the foreseeable future. Similarly, if a stock hits 52 week low, some traders believe it indicates a bearish trend for the foreseeable future.
-  **All-time high/low** – This is similar to the 52 weeks high and low, with the only difference being that the all-time high price is the highest price the stock had ever traded from when it was listed. Similarly, the all-time low price is the lowest price the stock had ever traded from when it was listed.
- **Upper and Lower Circuit** – The exchange sets up a price band within which the stock can be traded on a given trading day. The highest price the stock can reach on the day is the upper circuit limit, and the lowest price is the lower circuit limit. The limit for a stock is set to 2%, 5%, 10%, or 20% based on the exchange’s selection criteria. The exchange places these restrictions to control excessive volatility when a stock reacts to certain news related to the company. The criteria (in terms of exchange restriction) changes for derivatives stocks (and index); more on that later.
- **Long Position** – Long position or going long is a reference to the direction of your trade. For example, if you have bought or intend to buy Biocon shares, you are long on Biocon or planning to go long on Biocon, respectively. If you have bought the Nifty Index with an expectation that the index will trade higher, you have a long position on Nifty. You are considered bullish if you are long on a stock or an index.
- **Short Position** – Going short or ‘shorting’ is a term used to describe a transaction carried out in a particular order. This is a slightly tricky concept. To help you understand the concept of shorting, I’d like to narrate an old incident at work; this happened around mid-2014, if I remember right.

The concept of shorting is very counter-intuitive to normal humans because we are not used to ‘shorting’ in our day-to-day activity unless we have a trader mentality

 on day 1, you buy Wipro shares at Rs.405, two days later (day 3), the stock moves, and you sell your shares at Rs.425. You made a profit of Rs.20/- on this transaction.

In this transaction, your first leg was to buy Wipro at Rs.405, the second leg was to sell Wipro at Rs.425, and you were bullish on the stock.

On day 4, the stock is trading at Rs.425, and you are now bearish. You are convinced that the stock will go back to Rs.405. Is there a way you can profit from your bearish expectation? You could, and it can be done by shorting the stock.

You sell the stock at Rs.425, and 2 days later, assuming the stock trades at Rs.405, you repurchase it.

 trade’s first leg was to sell at Rs.425, and the second leg was to buy the stock at Rs.405. This is always the case with shorting – you first sell at a price you perceive as high to buy it back at a lower price later.

 The important point to remember is that when you short a stock, you must ensure that you buy back the stock the same day before the market closes. Of course, you can short a stock in the derivatives segment and carry forward the position for a few days. But at this point, ignore the derivatives bit and understand that all short positions in stocks (also called cash segment) have to be closed before the market closes. In other words, a short position in the cash market works only on an intraday basis.
 - 1. When you short, you have a bearish view of the stock. You profit if the stock price goes down. After you short, if the stock price goes up, you will end up making a loss.
2. When you short a stock, ensure you buy the stock back the same day before the market closes unless you use derivatives to short.
3. Shorting a stock is easy – you select the stock you wish to short and click on sell.

|Position|1st Leg|2nd Leg|Expectation|Make money when|You will lose money if|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Long|Buy|Sell|Bullish|Stock goes up|Stock price drops|
|Short|Sell|Buy|Bearish|Stock goes down|Stock price goes up|

Square off is a term used to indicate that you intend to close an existing position. If you are long on a stock squaring off the position means selling the stock

Squaring off a position means repurchasing the stock when you are short on the stock. Remember, when you repurchase it, you are just closing an existing position, and you are not going long!

|When you are|Square off position is|
|---|---|
|Long|Sell the stock|
|Short|Buy the stock|

Intraday position **_–_** This is a trading position you initiate with an expectation to square off the position within the same day. For example, all short positions in stocks are intraday

 OHLC ­– OHLC in stock prices refers to open, high, low, and close. We will understand more about this in the technical analysis module. For now, open is the price at which the stock opens for the day, high is the highest price at which the stock trade during the day, low is the lowest price at which the stock trades during the day, and close is the closing price of the stock. For example, the OHLC of ACC on 17th June was 1486, 1511, 1467, and 1499.

 Volumes and their impact on stock prices are important concepts that we will explore in greater detail in the technical analysis module. Volumes represent the total transactions (buy and sell put together) for a particular stock on a particular day. For example, on 17th June, the volume on ACC was 5, 33,819 shares.

Market Segment – A market segment is a division within which a certain type of financial instrument is traded. Each financial instrument is characterized by its risk and reward

1. Capital Market (CM) – Capital market segments offer tradable securities, such as stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). So if you were to buy or sell shares of a company, you are essentially operating in the capital market segment. Shorting stocks, too, comes under the capital market segment. The cash market is sometimes referred to as the spot market.
2. Futures and Options (FO) – Futures and Options, generally referred to as the equity derivative segment, are where leveraged products are traded. We will explore the derivative markets in greater depth in the derivatives module (Futures modules and Options Module)
3. Currency Derivatives (CDS) – The CDS segment is where currency pairs like USD INR, EUR INR, JPY INR are traded. The trading is via futures and options; hence it’s called the currency derivative market.
4. Wholesale Debt Market (WDM) – The wholesale debt market deals with fixed-income securities. Debt instruments include government securities, treasury bills, bonds issued by a public sector undertaking, corporate bonds, corporate debentures, etc.

You can opt for a ‘**Limit**’ order when you are particular about the price you want to pay for a stock.

You can also opt for a **market order** when you intend to buy at market-available prices instead of a limited price.

## **The Stock Buy Order Form (on Zerodha, Upstox, etc.)**

When you want to **buy** a share (say, of **ITC**), you’ll use a form inside your broker’s trading platform. That form will ask for:

- **Exchange** (NSE or BSE)
    
- **Order Type** (Limit, Market, SL, SL-M)
    
- **Quantity** (how many shares)
    
- **Product Type** (CNC or MIS)
    
- Other optional details (trigger price, disclosed quantity)
    

Let’s go through these options **step-by-step**:

---

## 1️⃣ **Exchange Selection: NSE or BSE**

- **Default is NSE** (National Stock Exchange), but you can change to **BSE** if you prefer.
    
- Both exchanges list stocks like ITC. Choose one depending on liquidity or preference.
    

---

## 2️⃣ **Order Type: What Price Are You Willing to Pay?**

### 🔹 A. **Limit Order**

- **You set the exact price.**
    
- Example: ITC is trading at ₹262.25, but you want to buy it only if it drops to ₹261.
    
- You place a **limit order at ₹261**.
    
- If the price doesn’t reach ₹261, your order **won’t execute**.
    
- **Pros:** Price control
    
- **Cons:** Might miss the trade if price never hits ₹261.
    

---

### 🔹 B. **Market Order**

- **Buy at the current market price** (whatever it is at that moment).
    
- Example: You place a market order, and ITC is available at ₹262.25 — you'll get it at that or the next best price.
    
- **Pros:** Instant execution
    
- **Cons:** You don’t control the price — it might jump suddenly.
    

---

### 🔹 C. **SL (Stop-Loss) Order**

Used **after** you've already bought a stock, to **limit your losses**.

- Example:
    
    - You bought ITC at ₹262.25.
        
    - You don’t want to lose more than ₹7, so you place an SL order at ₹255.
        
    - If ITC falls to ₹255, your SL order becomes active and **sells the stock** to protect you from further losses.
        

But it needs a **Trigger Price** to become active.

### 🔹 D. **SL-M (Stop-Loss Market)**

Same as SL, **but instead of setting a price to sell**, you say “sell at market price” once it hits the trigger.

- **SL:** Stop Loss with a limit price.
    
- **SL-M:** Stop Loss with a market price (ensures execution once triggered).
    

---

## 3️⃣ **Quantity**

- How many shares you want.
    
- Example: You want **1 share** of ITC → enter **1** in the quantity box.
    

---

## 4️⃣ **Product Type: CNC vs MIS**

|**Product Type**|**Use Case**|**Meaning**|
|---|---|---|
|CNC (Cash and Carry)|**Delivery trade**|You will **own the share** in your **DEMAT account**. Use if you're holding for **days, months, or years**.|
|MIS (Margin Intraday Square-off)|**Intraday trade**|You plan to **buy and sell on the same day**. Broker gives extra leverage, but will **auto-close your position by 3:15 PM**.|

---

## 📦 Example Walkthrough

You want to buy **1 share of ITC at ₹261** using **CNC (Delivery)**:

1. Select **Exchange** = NSE
    
2. Select **Order Type** = Limit
    
3. Set **Price** = 261
    
4. Set **Quantity** = 1
    
5. Set **Product Type** = CNC
    
6. Press **Submit**
    

✅ If ITC falls to ₹261 and there’s a seller — **your order is executed**.

📥 You now own 1 share of ITC in your **DEMAT account**.

📨 Your broker and the exchange will send you a **confirmation**, and your order gets a **unique ID** (Order Ticket Number).


## **he order book and Trade book**

Think of the order book and trade book as online registers within the trading terminal. The order book keeps track of all the orders you have sent to the exchange, and the trade book tracks all the trades. Think of it this way – when you order goods on Amazon, you first add items to the cart. The cart is the order book. You can add items, delete, or modify the order from the cart (order book). But when you press the buy button on Amazon, the order gets placed, and a receipt is generated. The trade book is that receipt. You also get a detailed receipt emailed to you called a ‘Contract Note’; we will discuss that later; for now think about the trade book as a general receipt for all the trades you carry out on the terminal.

So the order book has all the details regarding your order. You can navigate to the order book by clicking the Orders tab.

[![](https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_134-1024x503.png)](https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_134.png)

The order book provides the details of the orders you have placed. You should access the order book to:

- - Double-check the order details – quantity, price, order type, product type
    - Modify the orders – For example, if you want to modify the buy order, say from 261 to 259.
    - Check Status – After placing the order, you can check the status. The status would state open if the order is completed partially, it would state completed if the order has been completed, and it would state rejected if your order has been rejected. You can also see the details of the rejection in the order book.

If you notice, there is an open order to buy one share of ITC at Rs.261.

If you hover over the pending orders, you can find the option to modify or cancel the order.

[![](https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_137.png)](https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_137.png)

By clicking ‘modify,’ the order form will be invoked, and you can make the desired changes to the order.

Once the order is processed, and the trade has been executed, the trade details will be available in the trade book. You can find the trade book just below the order book.

Here is a snapshot of the trade book:

[![](https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_138.png)](https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_138.png)

The trade book confirms that the user ordered to buy one share of ITC at Rs 262.2. Also, notice a unique exchange order number is generated for the trade.

So with this, our first task is complete!

We now officially own one share of ITC. This share will reside in our DEMAT account until you decide to sell it.

The next task is to track the price of Infosys. The first step would be to add Infosys to the market watch. We can do this by searching for Infosys in the search box.

[![](https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_139-300x182.png)](https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_139.png)

Once we select Infy, we press add to add it to the market watch.

[![](https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_141.png)](https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_141.png)

Notice we have two stocks on the watchlist now – Infy and ITC. We can now track live price information on Infosys. The last trade price is Rs.1014.75; the stock is down -0.11% from its previous day’s close of Rs.1015.85. Infosys opened the day at Rs.1014.80, making a low of Rs.998.40 and a high of Rs.1028.95. The volumes were 3.6 million shares.

Please note while the open price will be fixed at Rs. 1014.80, the high and low prices change as and when the price of Infosys changes. For example, if Infosys moves from Rs.1014.2 to Rs.1050, the high price will reflect Rs. 1050 as the new high.

Notice below that the LTP of Infosys is in green, and ITC is in red. The cell is highlighted in green if the current LTP is higher than the previous close, and red otherwise.

Have a look at the snapshot below:

[![](https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_142-300x184.png)](https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_142.png)

While writing this chapter, the price of Infosys moved from 1014.20 to 1020.80, and the color changed to red from blue.

Besides the basic information about the LTP, OHLC, and volume, we can also dig deeper to understand real-time market participation, which is available in market depth. I want to draw your attention to the blue and red numbers called the Bid and Offer prices.

If you want to buy a share, you need to buy it from a seller. The seller will offer the shares at a price that he or she thinks is fair. The price that the seller offers you is called the ‘**Offer Price.’** The offer price is highlighted in red. Let us analyze this in a bit more detail.

|Sl No|Offer Price|Offer Quantity|Number of Sellers|
|---|---|---|---|
|01|3294.80|2|2|
|02|3294.85|4|2|
|03|3295.00|8|2|
|04|3296.20|25|1|
|05|3296.25|5|1|

The first offer price is Rs.3294.80. At this particular moment, this is the best price to buy the stock and there are only two shares available at this price being offered by two different sellers (both of them are selling one share each). The next best price is Rs.3294.85. At this price, four shares are offered by two different sellers. The third best price is Rs.3295, at which eight shares are available, and two sellers offer this. So on and so forth.

he higher the asking price, the lower the priority. For example, the 5th position is an asking price of Rs.3296.25 for five shares. This is because the stock exchanges prioritize sellers willing to offer their shares at the lowest possible price.

 if you want to buy ten shares at Rs.3294.8, you can only buy two shares because only two are being offered at Rs.3294.8. However, if you are not particular about the price (aka limit price), you can place a market order. When you place a market order to buy 10 shares, this is how it will go –
- Two shares are bought @ Rs.3294.8
- Four shares are bought @ Rs.3294.85
- Four shares are bought @ Rs.3295.00

The ten shares will be bought at three different prices. Also, in the process, the LTP of Infosys will jump to Rs.3295 from Rs.3294.8

If you want to sell a share, you need to sell it to a buyer willing to buy it from you. The buyer will buy the shares at a price that they thinks is fair. The price that the buyer expects is called the ‘bid price.’ The bid price is highlighted in blue. Let us analyze this part in a bit more detail:

|Sl No|Bid Price|Bid Quantity|Number of Buyers|
|---|---|---|---|
|01|3294.75|10|5|
|02|3294.20|6|1|
|03|3294.15|1|1|
|04|3293.85|6|1|
|05|3293.75|125|1|
