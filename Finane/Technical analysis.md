Under the single candlestick pattern, we will be learning the following…

1. Marubozu
    1. Bullish Marubozu
    2. Bearish Marubozu
2. Doji
3. Spinning Tops
4. Paper umbrella
    1. Hammer
    2. Hanging man
5. Shooting star

Multiple candlestick patterns are a combination of multiple candles. Under the multiple candlestick patterns, we will learn the following:

1. Engulfing pattern
    1. Bullish Engulfing
    2. Bearish Engulfing
2. Harami
    1. Bullish Harami
    2. Bearish Harami
3. Piercing Pattern
4. Dark cloud cover
5. Morning Star
6. Evening Star

Of course, you must be wondering what these names mean. As I had mentioned in the previous chapter, some of the patterns retain the original Japanese name.

Candlestick patterns help the trader develop a complete point of view. Each pattern comes with an in-built risk mechanism. Candlesticks give an insight into both entry and stop-loss price.


- **Buy strength and sell weakness** – Strength is represented by a bullish (blue) candle and weakness by a bearish (red) candle. Hence whenever you are buying ensure, it is a blue candle day and whenever you are selling, ensure it’s a red candle day.
- **Be flexible with patterns (quantify and verify)** – While the textbook definition of a pattern could state certain criteria, there could be minor variations to the pattern owing to market conditions. So one needs to be a bit flexible. However, one needs to be flexible within limits, and hence it is always required to quantify the flexibility.
- **Look for a prior trend** – If you are looking at a bullish pattern, the prior trend should be bearish, and likewise, if you are looking for a bearish pattern, the prior trend should be bullish.

1. History tends to repeat itself – we modified this assumption by adding the factor angle.
2. Candlestick patterns can be broken down into single and multiple candlestick patterns.
3. There are three important assumptions specific to candlestick patterns.
    1. Buy strength and sell weakness.
    2. Be flexible – quantify and verify.
    3. Look for a prior trend.


### Marbozu candle stick 

![[Pasted image 20250703152514.png]]

 Bullish Marubozu - open =low , high = close
- there is so much buying interest in the stock that the market participants were willing to buy the stock at every price point during the day, so much so that the stock closed near its high point for the day. It does not matter what the prior trend has been, the action on the marubozu day suggests that the sentiment has changed and the stock is now bullish.
-  there is a surge of bullishness, and this bullish sentiment will continue over the next few trading sessions.
- Hence a trader should look at buying opportunities with the occurrence of a bullish marubozu.
- The **buying price** should be around the closing price of the marubozu.
![[Pasted image 20250703152658.png]]


 The OHLC data for the candle is: Open = 971.8, High = 1030.2, Low = 970.1, Close = 1028.4
textbook definition of a marubozu **Open = Low, and High = Close**. However, in reality, there is a minor variation to this definition. 

The price variation is not much when measured in percentage terms, for example, the variation between high and close is 1.8, which as a percentage of high is just 0.17%. **This is where the 2nd rule applies – Be flexible, Quantify and Verify**.

With this occurrence of a marubozu the expectation has turned bullish, and hence one would be a buyer of the stock. The trade setup for this would be as follows:

Buy Price = Around 1028.4 and Stoploss = 970.0

Having decided to buy the stock, when do we actually buy the stock? The answer to this depends on your risk appetite. Let us assume two types of a trader with different risk profiles – the risk-taker and the risk-averse.

- **The risk-taker** would buy the stock on the same day as the marubozu is being formed. However, the trader needs to validate the occurrence of a marubozu
- Validating is quite simple. Indian markets close at 3:30 PM. So, around 3:20 PM one needs to check if the **current market price (CMP) is approximately equal to the high price for the day, and the opening price of the day is approximately equal to the low price the day**
- **The risk-averse** trader would buy the stock on the next day, i.e. the day after the pattern has been formed. However, before buying the trader, ensure that the day is a bullish day to comply with rule number 1.
-  risk-averse buyer can buy the stock only around the close of the day. The disadvantage of buying the next day is that the buy price is way above the suggested buy price, and therefore the stoploss is quite deep. However, as a trade-off, the risk-averse trader is buying only after doubly confirming that the bullishness is indeed established.

- Bullish Marubozu = Strong sign to **buy**
- Use **Low of the candle** as **Stop Loss**
- Entry depends on your **risk style**
- Always **check candle structure near market close** to confirm pattern

(Asian Paints Ltd) where both the risk-taker, and the risk-averse trader would have been profitable.

Here is an example where the risk-averse trader would have benefited :

![[Pasted image 20250703153305.png]]


 In case of a bullish marubozu, the low of the stock acts as a stoploss. So after you initiate a buy trade, if the markets move in the opposite direction, you should exit the stock if price breaches the low of the marubozu.

 bullish marubozu qualified as a buy for both the risk-averse and the risk-taker. The OHLC is : O = 960.2, H = 988.6, L = 959.85, C = 988.5.
![[Pasted image 20250703153357.png]]

But the pattern eventually failed, and one would have booked a loss. The stoploss for this trade would be the low of marubozu, i.e. 959.85.

## Bearish Marubozu

open is equal to the high and close the is equal to low. Open = High, and Close = Low.

 so much selling pressure in the stock that the market participants actually sold at every price point during the day, so much so that the stock closed near its low point of the day.

(BPCL Limited), the encircled candle indicates the presence of a bearish marubozu. Notice the candle does not have an upper and a lower shadow. The OHLC data for the candle is as follows:

Open = 355.4, High = 356.0, Low = 341, Close = 341.7

The trade on the bearish marubozu would be to short BPCL approximately at 341.7 with a stoploss at the high point of the candle. In this case, the stoploss price is 356.0.

-  The risk-taker can initiate a short trade on the same day around the closing. Of course, he has to make sure that the candle is forming a bearish marubozu.
-  at 3:20 PM, the trader must confirm if the open is approximately equal to the high and the current market price is equal to the low price
-  If the condition is validated, then it is a bearish marubozu, a short position can be initiated.

If the trader is risk-averse, he can wait till the next day’s closing. The short trade will go through only by 3:20 PM next day after ensuring that the day is a red candle day. This is also to ensure that we comply with 1st rule – Buy strength, and Sell weakness.

In the BPCL chart above, both risk taker and risk-averse would have been profitable.

 Cipla Limited, where the bearish marubozu has been profitable for both risk-taker, and a risk-averse trader. Remember these are short term trades and one needs to be quick in booking profits.

Here is a chart showing a bearish marubozu pattern that would not have worked out for the risk-taker, but a risk-averse trader would have avoided initiating the trade, thanks to rule 1.

![[Pasted image 20250703153755.png]]

One should avoid trading during a minimal (below 1% range) or long candle (above 10% range).

1. Remember the rules based on which candlesticks work.
2. Marubozu is the only pattern which violates rule number 3, i.e. Look for the prior trend.
3. A bullish marubozu indicates bullishness.
    1. Buy around the closing price of a bullish marubozu
    2. Keep the low of the marubozu as the stoploss
4. A bearish marubozu indicates bearishness.
    1. Sell around the closing price of a bearish marubozu
    2. Keep the high of the marubozu as the stoploss
5. An aggressive trader can place the trade on the same day as the pattern forms.
6. Risk-averse traders can place the trade on the next day after ensuring that it obeys rule number 1, i.e. Buy strength, and Sell weakness.
7. Abnormal candle lengths should not be traded.
    1. Short candle indicates subdued activity.
    2. Long candle indicates extreme activity; however, placing stoploss becomes an issue.


![[Pasted image 20250703153900.png]]

Two things are quite prominent…

- The candles have a small real body.
-  The upper and lower shadow is almost equal.

**Small real body** – This indicates that the open price and close price are quite close. For instance, the open could be 210, and the close could be 213. Or the open could be 210 and close at 207.
- oth these situations lead to creating a small real body because a 3 point move on a 200 Rupee stock is not much. Because the open and close price points are nearby to one another, the colour of the candle does not really matter
- e points are nearby to one another, the colour of the candle does not really matter. It could be a blue or a red candle, what really matters is that the open prices and close prices are near to one another.


 **upper shadow** – The upper shadow connects the real body to the high point of the day.
 -  If it is a red candle, the high and open are connected. If it is a blue candle, the high and close are connected
 - If you think about the real body in conjunction with the upper shadow ignoring the lower shadow, what do you think had happened? The presence of the upper shadow tells us that the bulls did attempt to take the market higher. However, they were not really successful in their endeavour.
 -  If the bulls were truly successful, then the real body would have been a long blue candle and not really a short candle. Hence this can be treated as an attempt by the bulls to take the markets higher, but they were not really successful at it.
