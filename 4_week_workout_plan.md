#### Progression and Tracking

To ensure continued progress, the user should implement progressive overload by increasing weights, reps, or difficulty of exercises weekly. For example, if Dumbbell Incline Press was done at 10kg for 12 reps in week 1, aim for 12.5kg or 13 reps in week 2. Calisthenics like pullups should aim for reduced assistance or more reps, and core exercises like planks can extend duration by 5-10 seconds.

The user should continue using Strong for workout tracking and MyFitnessPal for nutrition (2,000-2,200 kcal/day, with 110-150g protein, 200-250g carbs, 60-70g fat) to monitor fat loss and muscle gains. Weekly measurements of arm circumference, weight, and abs visibility will help assess progress toward the six-pack and bigger arms goals.
