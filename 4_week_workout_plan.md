### **Progression Tips**

- **Strength**: Increase machine/dumbbell weight or reps every 1-2 weeks as exercises get easier.
- **Calisthenics**: Progress pushups (e.g., weighted or archer) and pullups (reduce assistance over time).
- **Core**: Extend plank duration or add weight to twists/raises.
- **Cardio**: Increase intensity (e.g., faster sprints) or duration slightly.

### **Rest Time Between Sets**

- **Machines/Dumbbells**: 60-90 sec
- **Calisthenics**: 30-60 sec
- Keep rest tight to fit within 60 minutes.

### **Nutrition Plan**

To lose fat and reveal your six-pack while building arm size, you need a calorie deficit with high protein:

- **Daily Calories**: ~2,000-2,200 kcal
    - Based on your height (173 cm), weight (69.5 kg), and moderate activity, maintenance is ~2,500-2,700 kcal. A 300-500 kcal deficit supports fat loss.
- **Macronutrients**:
    - **Protein**: 110-150g (1.6-2.2g/kg for muscle growth)
    - **Carbs**: 200-250g (energy for workouts)
    - **Fat**: 60-70g (hormonal health)
- **Rest Days**: Maintain ~2,200 kcal to aid recovery.

**Adjustments**:

- If fat loss stalls after 2-3 weeks, drop 100-200 kcal.
- If energy dips, increase slightly.
